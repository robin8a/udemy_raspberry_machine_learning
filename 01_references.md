## Real Time Object Detection on Raspberry Pi using YOLO, Yad2k
The purpose of this project is to attach a USB camera to a Raspberri Pi and then automatically detect objects that the camera sees.
Also uses Docker, is quit interesting for DevOps

# Create your own clasifier
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001.
